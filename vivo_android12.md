The custom font cannot be changed in Themes version 7 and above. So it is required to install the zFont Plugin with the help of ADB (Android Debug Bridge).
ADB can be used with a PC or another Android device. It can also be used just on your current device with the help of Wireless debugging without any other devices.

For now, there are three ways to install the zFont Plugin with Wireless debugging. They do the same thing in common even though they have different steps.

## 1. Direct (Recommended)

This method does not need any other app.

- Tap on "Developer options".

> (You will be directed to "About phone" of your phone settings if you haven't already enabled the Developer options. Go into "Software information" and tap 7 times continuously to the "Build number".)

- When you're in the Developer options, find "Wireless debugging" and enable it.

- Open Wireless debugging by tapping directly on it.

- Tap on "Pair device with paring code", and you will see a 6-digit code.

- See the notification from zFont 3 and reply to it with the pairing code only.

- If the zFont notification shows "Pairing successful", go back to the zFont 3 and tap on "Start" to install the zFont Plugin.

> (If the "Searching for wireless debugging service" dialog appears, go to the Developer options, and turn off and turn on Wireless debugging toggle switch. Go back to the zFont 3, and it will be done automatically for you.)

**You can change any fonts you want after installing the zFont Plugin.**

If this method doesn't work, try another method.

## 2. Shizuku

First, if you don't have the Shizuku app on your phone, you will be asked to install it through the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=moe.shizuku.privileged.api).
- Once in Shizuku, you can start to run Shizuku in any method you like.
- If **Shizuku is running**, return to zFont 3 and select Shizuku again.
- Allow zFont 3 to use Shizuku if it asks for permission.

After installing the zFont Plugin, you can change the font you like.

## 3. Brevent & others

**Brevent** is also a free app that can use *ADB*.
You can install it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.piebridge.brevent).
- After installing, *start the Brevent server* following their instructions.
- **Copy** the command shown in *zFont 3*.
- Then open the **Brevent** app and click on the Drawer **menu on the left**.
- Go into the **Exec command** section, *paste the command copied from zFont 3 and execute it*.
- After installing the zFont Plugin, you can change any fonts you like.

You can execute that command in Any app that has access to ADB.
